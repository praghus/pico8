# My Pico-8 Carts Repository

This repository contains PICO-8 cartridges and related assets. It is organized to keep carts (`*.p8`) together with backups, exported images, and tools useful for development.

Repository layout:

- `carts/` — main PICO-8 cartridges (`*.p8`)
- `backup/` — backups and exported carts
- `cdata/`, `cstore/`, `plates/` — project-specific data and assets
- `tools/` — utilities and scripts for building/exporting carts

Quick start

1. Install PICO-8 (download from https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
2. Open a cart in the PICO-8 application: File → Open → select `carts/your_cart.p8`.
3. Or run from command line (if `pico8` CLI is available):

```powershell
pico8 -run carts\your_cart.p8
```
